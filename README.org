* scripts
This repository contains just some scripts that i use/made.
If you find anything interesting/useful you may take it :D

** tl.py
tl = timelogger

The org-mode support on mobile is rather sparse and does not cover all features of org-mode.
Because there is not really a convenient way of clocking into and out of tasks/headings i made this script.

It works in conjunction with ~termux-dialog~ and ~termux-toast~.

*** Dependencies
- python3
- *termux-api*
- jq
- date
- grep
