The org-mode support on mobile is rather sparse and does not cover all features of org-mode.
Because there is not really a convenient way of clocking into and out of tasks/headings i made this script.

It works in conjunction with ~termux-dialog~ and ~termux-toast~.

*** Dependencies
- python3
- *termux-api*
- jq
- date
- grep

** tmux-session-manager
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       33fa9c5b-00cb-4a2a-abd0-e963958adaad
:END:
With this you can save sessions, name them and later restore them.
It is just a small script, which works on top of ~tmux-resurrect~.

*** Dependencies
- tmux
- tmux-resurrect
- fzf (could be replaced though)

*** setup
Before you can get started with this you should first have ~tmux-resurrect~ working and also know its saving directory.
By default the saving dir is in ~~/.tmux/resurrect~.

Then download the two script files and put them somewhere sensible.
After that change the path of the save dir in *both* scripts to your path.

Put the following in your ~.tmux.conf~:
#+begin_src
# Also change the paths here
set -g @resurrect-hook-post-save-all 'tmux display-popup -E "~/scripts/tmux-session-manager/nameSession.sh"'
set -g @resurrect-hook-pre-restore-all 'bash ~/scripts/tmux-session-manager/choose.sh'
#+end_src

And optionaly add a keybind for (re)naming sessions:
#+begin_src
# Change the path here
bind N run-shell -b 'tmux display-popup -E "~/scripts/tmux-session-manager/nameSession.sh"'
#+end_src

Reload your tmux confing and your done :D
